Backend Test:

  Summary:
    Esusu Confam Ltd, a long-running Co-operative in Nigeria wants to digitalise their operations so 
    they have contacted you - a backend developer to help them with it. They want to build a simple
    platform that helps them save a fixed amount automatically every week and then one of the
    members collects the money at the end of every month.
    
    At the beginning of the tenure, a random table of who collects all the money each month is
    generated for the group. When a new member joins, they are automatically added to the bottom
    of the list. The group can contain any number of members and the platform can contain any
    number of groups.
    
    Every group has a group admin. The periodic amount to be saved at the beginning is defined by
    the admin. Other things defined by the admin include group name, group description, maximum
    capacity, if the group is searchable or not.
    Your task is to create a REST API for this with node.js
